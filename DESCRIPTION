Description: Calculates intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for assessing reproducibility of interval-censored data with two repeated measurements (Kovacic and Varnai (2014) <doi:10.1097/EDE.0000000000000139>). ICC is estimated by maximum likelihood from model with one fixed and one random effect (both intercepts). Help in model checking (normality of subjects' means and residuals) is provided.
